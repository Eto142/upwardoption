    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Refunds after successful completion of the Challenge</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">After you have successfully completed Phase 2 of the <a href="../index.html">Challenge</a> and proceeded to the funded phase you will receive a refund of the initial fee (except reset fees) with your first monthly withdrawal. Your sign up fee will not be refunded until you have generated sufficient profits for a withdrawal.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Refund Policy Post</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">After a cleared payment on the purchase of one of our programs occurs, you will receive an email with the login details to access your trading platform. Once this information is emailed to you, no refund will be given. In some cases, if the account has not been traded and the order is not older than 60 days our team will analyze if a refund is possible. In order to check the availability of a refund please contact us via live chat or via <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e99a9c9999869b9da99d86999d808c9b9d9b888d8c9bc78a8684">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Failed Transaction Policy</h2>
    <p>For failed transactions, receipt requests can be made after a minimum of 3 business days. Most banks resolve such issues within 48 &#8211; 72 business hours. This brief waiting period ensures banking institutions have an opportunity to reverse the transaction independently.
