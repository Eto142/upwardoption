The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims with regards to these Terms or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision, shall be determined by the arbitrator.

    <p>Any physical complaints notices and requests for arbitration can be sent to:</p>

    <p><a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#aad9dfdadac5d8deeadec5dadec3cfd8ded8cbcecfd884c9c5c7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1b686e6b6b74696f5b6f746b6f727e696f697a7f7e6935787476">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
    <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
   
<p>Any arbitration under these terms and conditions will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. The parties agree that a party may bring claims against the other only in each individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any putative class, collective, and/or representative proceeding, such as in the form of a private attorney general action against the other. Further, unless both you and Upwardoptiontrade agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

 <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

<p>The information, software, products, and services included in or available through the site may include inaccuracies or typographical errors. Changes are periodically added to the information herein. upwardoption.net, LLC and/or its suppliers may make improvements and/or changes to the site at any time.</p>

<p>upwardoption.net, LLC and/or its suppliers make no representations about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, and accuracy of the information, software, products, services, and related graphics contained on the site for any purpose. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, all such information, software, products, services, and related graphics are provided without warranty or condition of any kind. upwardoption.net, LLC and/or its suppliers hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions with regard to this information, software, products, services, and related graphics, including all implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall upwardoption.net, LLC and/or its suppliers be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages or any damages whatsoever including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data or profits, arising out of or in any way connected with the use or performance of the site, with the delay or inability to use the site or related services, the provision of or failure to provide services, or for any information, software, products, services and related graphics obtained through the site, or otherwise arising out of the use of the site, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if upwardoption.net, LLC or any of its suppliers has been advised of the possibility of damages. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the site, or with any of these terms of use, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the site.</p>
    <p>Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, because the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs, in general, are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.</p>

    <p>Upwardoptiontrade reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Miami-Dade County, New Jersey, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site, should arbitration efforts fail.

Upwardoptiontrade’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal processes, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Upwardoptiontrade’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by Upwardoptiontrade with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision or statement that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Upwardoptiontrade with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Upwardoptiontrade with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
