                                <p>The events on the EpitomeTrade economic calendar are pre-scheduled, and include statements made by countries and other leading players in the financial arena such as central banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and others. A declaration stating the monthly unemployment rate of a country, for example, can cause fluctuations in the local currency value.</p>
                                <p>The preference of central banks and other major players is towards a calm and stable market, and in this way most instruments usually act. However, sometimes events can create major waves massively impacting the financial markets.</p>

                                <p>Experienced traders know how to plan and perform their trades according to the calendar both before and following the events. Using the economic calendar is part of Fundamental analysis, trying to predict which way the market will go in order to make informed and wise trades.</p>
                                <p>Before an event from the calendar takes place, the trader will study the general state of the economy, review similar past events and more. Based on those factors and others, he will try to speculate the effects the event will have on various instruments. This is the basis of fundamental analysis – predicting the market trends based the current finance situation, past patterns and volumes etc.</p>
                                <p>Some traders, usually more experienced ones, will open positions before the financial event. If such a trader speculates that the announcement will bring to a rise of the instrument’s value, he will open a buying position prior to it, in order to sell it once it will go up and take profit. Other traders, however, will linger with their trades until after the announcement as part of their risk management.</p>

                                <p>On the first Friday of every month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the overall number of employees in the US, excluding some fields such as government workers, agriculture and non-profits. This report is called the ‘Non-Farm Payroll’. It reflects approximately 80% of the US working force. Financial news desks and companies post forecasts relating to this announcement.</p>
                                <p>This triggers attention by traders, anticipating the announcement and trying to predict and plan trades. Once announced, traders compare the report to their speculations before the release. If the rate is better than forecasted relevant markets will experience a rise. A higher unemployed number, however, will cause most markets to decline. The non-farm payroll can affect the many other fields such as costumer consumption rate, stocks and more. This is why it is considered an event with major financial influence.</p>
                                <p>It is important to bear in mind that any trends that occur after the event is also influenced by many other factors. There is no certainty the market will react the exact same way every time, since there are many other elements that affect it.</p>

                                        <strong>Why is an economic calendar an important tool?</strong>
                                        <p>There are many economic data points that are released from countries all around the world. These economic reports have an impact on financial markets, from currencies to commodities to stocks and bonds. Without a good economic calendar, one that is complete with all the important economic releases, any trader could get blindsided by an unanticipated market move. For example, manufacturing data is often important for the stock market, and for certain commodities like crude oil. A positive manufacturing data report can lift markets, while a poor report can cause sharp selloffs. If you aren’t aware of upcoming reports like this you could easily be on the wrong side of a trade.</p>

                                        <strong>Where can I find the best economic calendar?</strong>

                                        <strong>How do I use an economic calendar?</strong>
                                        <p>If you want to properly analyse any market it is critical that you have all the relevant information, and that you know how to use it. The economic calendar will deliver all the relevant information about when you can expect certain market moving data to be released. Once you’re aware of the release of this data you can go find out more about how the data moves the markets, and what to expect from the current data release. Based on that information you can develop a hypothesis on which assets you should be buying, and which you should be selling. If your analysis is correct you can expect your trading account to continue growing.</p>
